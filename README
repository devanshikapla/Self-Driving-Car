This repository contains a self-driving car simulation coded in JavaScript, which is powered by neural networks to drive autonomously.Neural networks act in a manner similar to the human brain. For instance, when a car is detected in front of our self-driving car, it slows down and applies brakes, just as humans would. The neural network, much like genetic mutation, adapts by altering its structure randomly to perform specific tasks better.The car utilizes a sensor technique that detects nearby vehicles within a certain radius. This allows the car to sense the presence of cars in its vicinity and make adjustments accordingly, such as changing its direction or maneuvering to avoid collisions.

First, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed, which was later optimized using genetic algorithms. This optimization process involved fine-tuning the neural network's parameters to enhance its performance. Additionally, a graphical traffic simulation was implemented to create a visually appealing representation of the self-driving car's interaction with traffic scenarios. This combined approach aimed to create a more realistic and visually satisfying simulation of the self-driving car's behavior in traffic.This repository contains a self-driving car simulation coded in JavaScript, which is powered by neural networks to drive autonomously.Neural networks act in a manner similar to the human brain.
