This repository contains a self-driving car simulation coded in JavaScript, which is powered by neural networks to drive autonomously.Neural networks act in a manner similar to the human brain. For instance, when a car is detected in front of our self-driving car, it slows down and applies brakes, just as humans would. The neural network, much like genetic mutation, adapts by altering its structure randomly to perform specific tasks better.The car utilizes a sensor technique that detects nearby vehicles within a certain radius. This allows the car to sense the presence of cars in its vicinity and make adjustments accordingly, such as changing its direction or maneuvering to avoid collisions.
